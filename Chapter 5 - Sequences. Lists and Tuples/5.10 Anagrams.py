(Anagrams) An anagram of a string is another string formed by rearranging the let-
ters in the first. Write a script that produces all possible anagrams of a given string using
only techniques that youâ€™ve seen to this point in the book. [The itertools module pro-
vides many functions, including one that produces permutations.]
